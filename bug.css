The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This rule is less specific than the p selector */
}
```

The `div p` selector, while seemingly targeted, is actually overridden by the more specific `p` selector. This is because the `p` selector is more specific due to its element-based nature compared to the combined selector `div p`.

This issue might lead to unexpected results where the intended styling on the paragraph element inside the div is not applied because the specificity of `p{color:red;}` is higher than `div p {color:green;}`.
