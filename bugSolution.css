The solution to this issue is to increase the specificity of the selector targeting paragraphs within divs. There are several ways to achieve this:

**Method 1: Increase Specificity using IDs**

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

#myParagraph {
  color: green;
}
```

With this HTML: `<div><p id="myParagraph">This is a paragraph</p></div>`

**Method 2: Using a more specific selector**

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div > p {
  color: green; /* This is more specific because it uses a direct child selector */
}
```

These changes ensure that the intended style is applied, demonstrating a correct understanding and application of CSS specificity.
